# Mastermind

Console version of board game Mastermind.
Code Pegs are represented by numbers [0-4] while the result pegs are represented by 0 for white peg and 1 for black peg
To insert pattern/guess please write numbers separately for each peg.
In singleplayer mode, computer player doesn't have implemented any special algorithm yet (random compinations) so it's easy to win :)

Enjoy
